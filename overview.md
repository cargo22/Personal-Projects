Hello! Welcome to my personal projects page. This is where I'll list all my projects to be made public.

# Tetris
My first full-fledged personal project! Other than my high school CS class, this is my first project done on my own. I hope you all enjoy! To play,
visit this repository: (you're going to need VS Code and GitHub desktop)

[(https://github.com/cargo22/Personal-Projects)](https://github.com/cargo22/Personal-Projects)

Once you've reached the page, click the green "Code" button and press open in GitHub desktop. Then click "open in Visual Studio" and you'll see all the code used to create this project. Then, right click the HTML file and click "reveal in file explorer." This will lead you to the files in your file explorer. Now double click on the HTML file and it should redirect you to your browser. Now you should have full access to the game. Enjoy!

# A Fun Website
This project was a quick and creative way for me to give my girlfriend what she wanted: a formal Valentine proposal. Because we're long distance, I didn't really get the chance to ask her in person, so this was how I planned on doing so. It's a fun and light-hearted project that I really enjoyed and I hope you enjoy it too!

To access it, just open the Mystery Project foler, and start open the "puzzle.html" file. That's where you begin, and the rest will come as you progress. Be prepared to answer some fun riddles!
