Hello! Welcome to my personal projects page. This is where I'll list all my projects to be made public.

# Tetris
My first full-fledged personal project! Other than my high school CS class, this is my first project done on my own. I hope you all enjoy! To play,
visit this repository: (you're going to need VS Code and GitHub desktop)

[(https://github.com/cargo22/Personal-Projects)](https://github.com/cargo22/Personal-Projects)

Once you've reached the page, click the green "Code" button and press open in GitHub desktop. Then click "opne in Visual Studio" and you'll see all the code used to create this project. Then, right click the HTML file and click "reveal in file explorer." This will lead you to the files in your file explorer. Now double click on the HTML file and it should redirect you to your browser. Now you should have full access to the game. Enjoy!
