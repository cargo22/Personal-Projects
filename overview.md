Hello! Welcome to my personal projects page. This is where I'll list all my projects to be made public.

# Tetris
My first full-fledged personal project! Other than my high school CS class, this is my first project done on my own. I hope you all enjoy! To play,
visit this repository:

[https://github.com/cargo22/Personal-Projects]

Once you've reached the page, click the green "Code" button and download the repository. Then, open it in your file explorer and click on the 
Tetris folder. Within the folder, you will find all the code to the game. Double click the HTML file, and it should redirect you to your browser and allow you to play the game. Enjoy!
