Hello there! Welcome to my personal Tetris game. I'm a massive fan of the franchise, so I was interested in making my own spin on the game. 
As an avid player of the game, I immediately had a picture in my head of how I wanted my game to turn out. I hope you enjoy!

Preface: 
I first want to preface the fact that I drew inspiration from a few sources. First, I followed a tutorial from the YouTube channel freeCodeCamp.org.
The lovely creators put together a step-by-step tutorial on how to create a basic tetris game. Here's the link if you're interested: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAUn1Lom6dw&t=1s]
Essentially, I used this video as a stepping stool and built on it using my own ideas. 

I also used openAI's popular ChatGPT tool to help me understand more about the languages, as I'm pretty new to javascript, HTML, and css. ChatGPT was 
extremely useful in teaching me the basics to the language and helped me solve a couple of problems I've encountered along the way.

If you're interested in playing, download the code and open the HTML file. It should redirect you to your browser of choice, allowing you to play 
the game. Enjoy!
